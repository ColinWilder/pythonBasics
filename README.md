Code I use in teaching Digital History at the University of South Carolina. Most of this is based on the Programming Historian. 

All of my students at USC, and everyone else, is welcome to use this code. If the comments indicate that the code is substnatially mine rather than being based on someone else's work, I would appreciate an acknowledgement if you use it.
